Package: lazyraster
Version: 0.5.0
Title: Generate Raster Data Lazily from 'GDAL' 
Description: Read raster data at a specified resolution on-demand. Augments
 the 'raster' package by never reading data from a 'GDAL' source until absolutely
 necessary for generating an in-memory 'raster' object. A 'lazyraster' object
 may be cropped and turned into a 'raster' object, and by default will only 
 read a small amount of data sufficient for a an overall summary. The amount 
 of data read can be controlled by specifying the output dimensions.

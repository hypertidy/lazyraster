A lazyraster provides a simple way to explore any large raster data that is readable by GDAL [https://gdal.org/]((the Geospatial Data Abstraction Library)). 

As with the [raster package](https://CRAN.r-project.org/package=raster) the `lazyraster()` function reads no
data but builds an object that understands the original file source. 

```{r setup}
library(lazyraster)

sstfile <- system.file("extdata/sst.tif", package = "vapour")

lr <- lazyraster(sstfile)
lr
```

As with raster, we can plot the object to get a quick summary - but note that we haven't yet had our . 

```{r plot}
plot(lr, col = hcl.colors(12, "YlOrRd", rev = TRUE))
```
